This code creates an html file with a map on which there are labels displaying the coordinates of places where films were shot in a certain year. 
Only 10 or fewer markers whose coordinates are closest to the coordinates you entered will be displayed on the map.

- longitude and latitude (coordinates of the place from which you want to find the nearest locations)
- path to the file in which the data is stored

Example:
- input in the command line: python main.py 2009 49.83826 24.02324 loc.txt
- name of created file: Maps_Maker.html
